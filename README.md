# Zak Yeomanson's PowerShell Portfolio

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Zak Yeomanson <br>
This is a personally designed website that simulates a terminal interface in the web. I use this simulation as an interface for my portfolio, providing a unique experience.

The interface allows users to enter commands using the Enter key and view them as part of the terminal history. By entering commands, you may navigate my portfolio or have fun trying the commands I've implemented.

## Features

- Custom Terminal UI with a blinking caret
- Input field for command entry
- Display area for previous commands

## Planned Features

- Command recognition & processing, e.g:
  - `help` -> View existing commands list
  - `projects` -> View my developer projects
  - `cd` -> Change directory
  - `mkdir` -> Make a directory
  - `open` -> Open a URL
- Terminal themes
- Swap operating systems e.g: Ubuntu, MacOS
- Swap from block caret to line caret

## Usage & Installation

If you wish to load this project locally, you must run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/ZakYeo/website_portfolio.git
cd website_portfolio
npm install
npm start
```
